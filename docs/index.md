# Welcome to CommX Wiki

A **MkDocs-powered knowledge base** for UC Team projects.

## What's inside?

Specially structured sections designed for different audiences — newcomers, advanced users (admins), developers, integrators, and QA specialists.

## Let's build it together

You are welcome to enrich this wiki with your **knowledge, experience, and best practices**.  
Share your vision of our products, pipelines, and more with the team.

Every page in this wiki is a Markdown article.  
MkDocs compiles these pages into a simple, elegant website with **cross-links** and **convenient navigation** —  
the **right sidebar** for page contents and the **left sidebar** for section navigation.

Continuous deployment is easy and fast — just **push new content** to update the site.
